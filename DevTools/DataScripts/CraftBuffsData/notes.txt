Test Buff: Phial of Quick Hands

each phial item (different qualities each) have different item ids and spellids respective

q1 phial:
itemID: 197720
spellID: 381264 (ItemEffect ("ItemID" -> "ID") -> ItemXItemEffect ("ID" -> "SpellID")) "The spell that is triggered when the item is used"

spellID -> SpellEffect ("SpellID" -> "EffectTriggerSpell") "This is the spellID of the buff/aura" Note: EffectAura is 0 (None) for this one
effectTriggerSpellID = 393665

SpellEffect ("SpellID" = effectTriggerSpellID)
effectAura: 285 (LINKED_2)
effect: 6 (APPLY_AURA)
"EffectTriggerSpell": 395802 -> This seems to be the aura spellid for the "baseAura"

plug again into SpellEffect to receive a spellID that states effectAura: 511 (APPLY_PROFESSION_EFFECT)
EffectMiscValue_0: 176 ... maybe a hint at the 18% crafting speed?

in SpellEffectAutoDescription: Use 511 as ID
here in the description one can see that its the crafting speed buff
